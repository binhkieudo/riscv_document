Before building your documents, it requires to install the dependencies.

```shel
apt install ruby-dev libcairo2-dev libpango1.0-dev libxml2-dev
```

The `makefile` internally uses asciidoctor so the packages required by the
`makefile` need to be installed on the build system using.

```shel
make install-debs
```

The final specification in form of PDF and HTML can be generated using
`make` command.

```shel
make
```
